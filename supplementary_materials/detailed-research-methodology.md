## Research Design

The research followed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques to gather comprehensive insights into the role of a Software Freestyle Engineer. This approach allowed for a deeper understanding of the subject matter and the ability to triangulate findings from different data sources.

Data Collection Methods:
1. Qualitative Data:
   a. In-depth Interviews: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with experienced Software Freestyle Engineers, project managers, and other stakeholders. The interview questions were designed to explore the responsibilities, skill set, collaboration practices, and perceived impact of Software Freestyle Engineers in modern IT environments.
   b. Focus Group Discussions: Focus group discussions were organized with cross-functional teams, including Software Freestyle Engineers and other team members, to gather insights into their collaboration experiences, challenges faced, and the effectiveness of interdisciplinary approaches.

2. Quantitative Data:
   a. Surveys: Online surveys were administered to a diverse group of software professionals, including Software Freestyle Engineers, software developers, project managers, and IT managers. The surveys included questions related to the participants' demographics, skill sets, collaboration practices, and perceptions of the role of a Software Freestyle Engineer.

Interview Protocols:
The interview protocols were carefully crafted to ensure consistency and gather relevant information. Open-ended questions were used to allow participants to provide detailed responses and share their experiences and perspectives. The interview protocols underwent a pilot testing phase to refine the questions and ensure clarity.

Case Study Procedures:
Multiple case studies were conducted to gain in-depth insights into the role of a Software Freestyle Engineer in real-world software development projects. The case study selection was based on diversity in project types, team compositions, and organizational contexts. Data for the case studies were collected through interviews, document analysis, and direct observation of project activities.

Data Analysis:
1. Qualitative Data Analysis:
   a. Thematic Analysis: The transcribed interviews and focus group discussions were analyzed using thematic analysis techniques. The data were coded, categorized, and analyzed to identify recurring themes, patterns, and key findings.
   b. Content Analysis: Document analysis was conducted on project documents, reports, and artifacts to extract relevant information for the case studies.

2. Quantitative Data Analysis:
   The survey data were analyzed using statistical software, which involved descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. The quantitative analysis provided numerical insights into the participants' demographics, skill sets, and perceptions.

Validity and Reliability:
To ensure the validity and reliability of the findings, various measures were implemented, including member checking, peer debriefing, and triangulation of data sources. These measures enhanced the credibility and trustworthiness of the research outcomes.

Ethical Considerations:
The research adhered to ethical guidelines, ensuring informed consent, confidentiality, and anonymity of the participants. Approval from the relevant ethics committee was obtained prior to data collection.

Conclusion:
This research methodology provided a comprehensive and rigorous approach to explore the role of a Software Freestyle Engineer in modern IT. By combining qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, the study obtained rich insights and multiple perspectives. The research design, interview protocols, case study procedures, and data analysis techniques employed in this study can serve as a valuable reference for future research on this topic.
